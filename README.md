## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Before, I used to question the widespread use of divs in every frontend project, seeing 
as it is not a semantic tag. Only when you begin styling -- specifically outlining -- that you see the benefit of it, especially
when for its most common uses cases, like a container for shared properties.

```css
@import url("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit");
h3 {
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```
You can import custom fonts and use them with ease.
```css
h3::first-letter{
  padding-left: 8px;
}
```
helps in giving indentation to first letter of a word or a phrase.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue to improve my native CSS skills.
